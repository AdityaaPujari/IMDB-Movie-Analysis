# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
## 1. Project Description
This project aims to analyze the factors influencing the success of movies on IMDb, with success defined by high IMDb ratings. The primary objective is to provide insights into what makes a movie successful on IMDb, benefiting stakeholders in the film industry such as producers, directors, and investors. By understanding the key drivers of movie success, stakeholders can make informed decisions for future projects.
## 2. Approach
* Data Collection: I have gathered a dataset containing information about movies from IMDb or other reliable sources. The dataset included variables such as IMDb ratings, genres, directors, budgets, actors, and release years. Dataset was comprehensive and representative, covering a diverse range of movies across different genres, budgets, and time periods. 
* Data Cleaning: Pre-processed the dataset using Microsoft Excel 2010 to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency in data types. Utilized Excel's sorting, filtering, and data manipulation capabilities to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. Conducted quality checks to verify the integrity and accuracy of the data, addressing any discrepancies or inconsistencies as needed.
* Data Analysis: Employed Excel's built-in functions and tools for descriptive statistics to calculate summary measures such as averages, standard deviations, and correlations. Also I have utilized Excel's pivot tables to analyze relationships between variables and identify patterns or trends in the data. Created visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots using Excel's charting tools to visually represent the analysis findings. Conducted hypothesis testing and statistical analysis where appropriate to assess the significance of observed relationships and differences. 
* Five 'Whys' Approach: Applied the 'Five Whys' technique within Excel to delve deeper into correlations and uncover causal relationships behind observed patterns. Iteratively asked "Why?" to investigate the underlying reasons for relationships identified in the analysis, leading to insights into the factors influencing movie success on IMDb.
* Report and Data Story: lastly I have compiled the analysis findings, insights, and recommendations into a comprehensive report using Microsoft Excel 2010.
## 3. Tech-Stack Used:
* In this project, Microsoft Excel 2010 was used primarily for data analysis and visualization. The purpose of using Excel 2010 was to leverage its familiar interface and powerful features for exploring the factors influencing movie success on IMDb.
* Overall, Microsoft Excel 2010 served as a versatile and accessible tool for conducting data analysis and visualization, allowing for the exploration of factors influencing movie success on IMDb in a user-friendly environment.
## 4. Insights:
